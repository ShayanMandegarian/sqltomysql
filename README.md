# sqltomysql
python program that transfers sql data to mysql

This repository contains 3 python scripts, SQLtoMySQL.py, SQLtoMySQLOLD.py, and deletemysql.py.

SQLtoMySQL.py is the main script, open it up and edit it with your correct SQL credentials, then ensure that you have the code from my
other repository-- https://github.com/ShayanMandegarian/jqgrid-database -- running correctly and with correct credentials and it should
work.
Note, this is mostly meant for personal use and will be a bit of a pain to get to work, if anyone is really using this.

<b>If you don't want to go through all that trouble,</b> use SQLtoMySQLOLD.py instead, all you will need to do is enter your correct 
credentials for MySQL and SQL and it will transfer when you run it. However, it is set up for a very specific database design in SQL and
MySQL. Understand how the code works, or send me a message and I can explain, and you should be able to edit it easily for it to work with
your own database.

Finally, deletemysql.py was a quick little script I made to easily delete all entries in my MySQL table for testing purposes, again you
will need to edit it to work with your own.
